# Humpback Whale Identification
Can you identify a whale by its tail?

## Data Description
This training data contains thousands of images of humpback whale flukes. Individual whales have been identified by researchers and given an Id. The challenge is to predict the whale Id of images in the test set. What makes this such a challenge is that there are only a few examples for each of 3,000+ whale Ids.
